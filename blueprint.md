# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a web-based casino application featuring three mini-games: "Lucky Spin", "Sevens Heaven", and "Cup of Fortune". The application is built using modern, framework-less web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user interface is designed to be intuitive, responsive, and visually engaging, with a focus on providing a premium and accessible user experience.

## Style, Design, and Features

### General

*   **Layout:** A clean, centered layout that is responsive and adapts to various screen sizes.
*   **Color Palette:** A vibrant and energetic color palette is used to create a visually appealing experience.
*   **Typography:** Expressive and relevant typography is used to guide the user and emphasize important information.
*   **Iconography:** Icons are used to enhance the user's understanding and navigation of the application.
*   **Interactivity:** Interactive elements such as buttons and other controls have a shadow and glow effect to provide a tactile feel.
*   **Animations:** Smooth animations are used to provide feedback to the user and enhance the overall experience.

### Games

*   **Lucky Spin:** A wheel-of-fortune style game where the user spins a wheel to win prizes.
    *   The wheel pointer now has a continuous bobbing animation to draw the user's attention.
    *   The "Spin" button has a pulsing glow effect to encourage the user to click it.
    *   The wheel has a blur effect while spinning to create a sense of speed.
*   **Sevens Heaven:** A roulette-style game where the user bets on the outcome of a spinning wheel.
    *   The wheel now rotates only once, and the animation is set to 4 seconds, resulting in a much faster game.
    *   The ball now lands precisely in the center of the winning number's pocket.
    *   The roulette ball has a subtle orbiting motion even when the wheel is not spinning.
    *   The ball does a "jiggle" animation when the user hovers over the "Spin Roulette" button.
    *   The winning pocket has a more intense glow when the ball lands on it.
*   **Cup of Fortune:** A shell game where the user tries to find a prize hidden under one of five cups.
    *   The cost to play is $7.
    *   The prize for finding a prize is $10.
    *   After each turn, all cups are revealed to show the player where the prize was located.
    *   The win message is now a more direct "You won $10!".
    *   The cups have a box-shadow to make them look more 3D.
    *   The cups lift up slightly when the user hovers over them.
    *   The cups have a "shaking" animation during the shuffling phase.

### Balance and Dev Mode

*   **Player Balance:** The user starts with a balance of $100, which is updated as they play the games.
*   **Developer Mode:** A developer mode is available that allows the user to play the games without any cost.
